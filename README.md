### What I learned


This project was a whole new level of a challenge for me and my knowledge so far, I did not know how to use the transform property from CSS nor the translate, or how to rotate a card. 

On the other hand, I struggled with CSS in some aspects too, but I´m getting more and more comfortable using it.


### Continued development

I still have to learn a lot about DOM control, because even though I’ve been feeling better with JavaScript, I still feel like a whole rookie trying to use properties like innerHTML or how to have full control over the stuff I try to do with JS.
